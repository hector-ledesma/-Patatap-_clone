# 'Patatap' clone

One of the more challenging exercises. As it was one of the first where we were left to our own devices to solve the challenge.

Tasked with recreating certain aspects from [patatap](https://patatap.com/). To do so, we had to read through the documentation until we understood how the library worked enough to get it to do what we needed.

We had to use [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) for the graphical aspect of it, and [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) for the sounds.
